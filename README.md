# The HTB Handbook project

This project is intended for anyone who wants to learn hacking on Hack The Box. It will be built using the experiences of my students as a way to always have good notes on working with HTB.

Every friday my students gather to hack on a machine on Hack The Box. From there, knowledge will be added to this repository.
